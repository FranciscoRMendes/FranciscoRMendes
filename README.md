### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 Welcome to my Github Repo. 
I am a senior AI Engineer at Renesas Electronics America. In my current role I focus primarily on implementing deep neural networks on embedded systems.
Most of my work is in the field of computer vision and signal processing for embedded systems. 

I love mathematics and algorithms and was hoping to use this blog to share some of my thoughts and ideas on these topics.
